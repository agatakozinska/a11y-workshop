# Standards

Accessibility isn't just a feeling.

## WCAG

The primary standards for web accessibility are outlined in the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**, which are developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

WCAG provides a set of internationally recognized guidelines for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.
Some guidelines can be automated with tools like Axe or WAVE, while many others require human review.
