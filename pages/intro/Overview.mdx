# Introduction


## Accessibility Fundamentals
“The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.” - W3C

## Disability is a part of life

An estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability. This represents 16% of the world’s population, or 1 in 6 of us. In the US live 61 million adults (26%) with some type of disability.

According to the World Health Organization, disability has three dimensions:

- Impairment in a person’s body structure or function, or mental functioning; examples of impairments include loss of a limb, loss of vision or memory loss.
- Activity limitation, such as difficulty seeing, hearing, walking, or problem solving.
- Participation restrictions in normal daily activities, such as working, engaging in social and recreational activities, and obtaining health care and preventive services.
