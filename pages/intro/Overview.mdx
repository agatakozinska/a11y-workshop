# Introduction


## Accessibility Fundamentals
“The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.” - W3C

## Disability is a part of life

An estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability. This represents 16% of the world’s population, or 1 in 6 of us. In the US live 61 million adults (26%) with some type of disability.

According to the World Health Organization, disability has three dimensions:

- **Impairment**: This refers to challenges in a person's physical or mental functioning, including issues like the loss of a limb, vision impairment, or memory loss.

- **Activity Limitation**: This involves difficulties individuals may face in performing various tasks or activities, such as seeing, hearing, walking, or problem-solving.

- **Participation Restrictions**: These are barriers that hinder individuals from fully engaging in their daily lives, such as challenges in working, participating in social or recreational activities, and accessing necessary healthcare and preventive services.
