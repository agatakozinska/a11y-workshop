# Benefits!

## SEO
Implementing accessibility features often aligns with best practices for search engine optimization (SEO). Accessible websites tend to have better structure, clearer content, and faster loading times, which can positively impact search rankings and visibility.

## Performance

The tree generated by the DOM may change a lot. When the tree changes, the browser notifies assistive technology that a section of the tree has changed or been updated. Making a JavaScript update to the DOM that triggers a reflow or repaint will almost certainly generate or rebuild an accessible object for it. State changes in ARIA do not recreate objects, but they do emit events. Many events are grouped to minimize the impact on performance (see <a class="link" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/EventCoalescing">Event Coalescing</a>). You may notice sometimes like screen reader hangs and waits till the browser tries to gather and construct the whole page from all resources.

## Cost Savings

Many countries have laws and regulations mandating web accessibility, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States and in June 2025, the European Accessibility Act (EAA) will be enforced in European Union member states.

Investing in web accessibility upfront can lead to long-term cost savings. Addressing accessibility issues during the design and development stages is often more efficient and cost-effective than retrofitting inaccessible features later.

## Users and Business Growth

Demonstrating a commitment to web accessibility not only benefits users directly by improving their access to digital content and services but also contributes to a more inclusive, welcoming, and user-friendly online experience for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It helps built trust and credibility among users, which can strengthen their reputation and brand image, which can also leads to enhancing competitiveness.
