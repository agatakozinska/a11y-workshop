# Screed Readers

Screen readers (a type of Assistive Technology) are both software and hardware that people use to interact with a computer. They convert text and graphics on a screen to speech or Braille output.

For Mac computers and phones with iOS system we have already built-in screen reader called VoiceOver. On Windows, users can employ the built-in screen reader Narrator or install third-party software like NVDA or JAWS.

## VO control keys

## Alt text

Alternative text provides a description to an image on a page. Alt text is read aloud to people using screen readers, providing **essential context**.
